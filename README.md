# Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Introduction to Machine Learning** repository! This repository is designed to help beginners learn the fundamental concepts and algorithms of machine learning.

## Overview of Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It involves training algorithms on data to enable them to make predictions or classifications.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on unlabeled data, and it tries to find patterns or groupings in the data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

## Algorithms Covered

This repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable.
- **Classification**: Algorithms like Decision Trees used for predicting categorical outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to assess the performance of machine learning models.
